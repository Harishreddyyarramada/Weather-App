This project is a simple weather web app built with React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS that lets users quickly check the current weather for any city using a free public API (no authentication required). It relies only on React’s built-in state management, keeping the app lightweight and beginner-friendly. A demo video is included, along with a short explanation of how I used a large language model (LLM) to assist with setup, styling, and troubleshooting.
